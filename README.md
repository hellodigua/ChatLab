ChatLab is an open-source desktop app for understanding your social conversations. It combines a flexible SQL engine with AI agents so you can explore patterns, ask better questions, and extract insights from chat data, all on your own machine.

Currently supported: **WhatsApp, LINE, WeChat, QQ, Discord, Instagram, and Telegram**. Coming next: **iMessage, Messenger, and KakaoTalk**.

## Core Features

- 🚀 **Built for large histories**: Stream parsing and multi-worker processing keep imports and analysis responsive, even at million-message scale.
- 🔒 **Private by default**: Your chat data and settings stay local. No mandatory cloud upload of raw conversations.
- 🤖 **AI that can actually operate on data**: Agent + Function Calling workflows can search, summarize, and analyze chat records with context.
- 📊 **Insight-rich visual views**: See trends, time patterns, interaction frequency, rankings, and more in one place.
- 🧩 **Cross-platform normalization**: Different export formats are mapped into a unified model so you can analyze them consistently.

## System Architecture

### Architecture Principles

- **Local-first by default**: Raw chat data, indexes, and settings remain on-device unless you explicitly choose otherwise.
- **Streaming over buffering**: Stream-first parsing and incremental processing keep large imports stable and memory-efficient.
- **Composable intelligence**: AI features are assembled through Agent + Tool Calling, not hard-coded into one model path.
- **Schema-first evolution**: Import, query, analysis, and visualization share a consistent data model that scales with new features.

### Runtime Architecture

- **Main Process (control plane)**: `electron/main/index.ts` handles lifecycle and windows. `electron/main/ipc/` defines domain-scoped IPC, while `electron/main/ai/` and `electron/main/i18n/` provide shared AI and localization services.
- **Worker Layer (compute plane)**: `electron/main/worker/` runs import, indexing, and query tasks via `workerManager`, keeping CPU-heavy work off the UI thread.
- **Renderer Layer (interaction plane)**: Vue 3 + Nuxt UI + Tailwind CSS drive management, private chat, group chat, and analysis interfaces. `electron/preload/index.ts` exposes tightly scoped APIs for secure process boundaries.

### Data Pipeline

1. **Ingestion**: `parser/` detects file format and dispatches to the matching parser module.
2. **Persistence**: Stream-based writes populate core local entities: sessions, members, and messages.
3. **Indexing**: Session- and time-oriented indexes are built for timeline navigation and retrieval.
4. **Query & Analysis**: `worker/query/*` powers activity metrics, interaction analysis, SQL Lab, and AI-assisted exploration.
5. **Presentation**: The renderer turns query output into charts, rankings, timelines, and conversational analysis flows.

### Extensibility & Reliability

- **Pluggable parser architecture**: Adding a new import source is mostly an extension in `parser/formats/*`, without reworking downstream query logic.
- **Full + incremental import paths**: `streamImport.ts` and `incrementalImport.ts` support both first-time onboarding and ongoing updates.
- **Modular IPC boundaries**: Domain-based IPC segmentation reduces cross-layer coupling and limits permission spread.
- **Unified i18n evolution**: Main and renderer processes share an i18n system that can evolve with product scope.

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Node.js >= 20
- pnpm

### Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# run electron app in dev mode
pnpm dev
```

### Common Scripts

```bash
# type checks (web + node)
pnpm type-check:all

# lint and auto-fix
pnpm lint

# format files
pnpm format

# build app
pnpm build
```

If Electron encounters exceptions during startup, you can try using `electron-fix`:

```bash
npm install electron-fix -g
electron-fix start

```

## Contributing

Please follow these principles before submitting a Pull Request:

- Obvious bug fixes can be submitted directly.
- For new features, please submit an Issue for discussion first; **PRs submitted without prior discussion will be closed**.
- Keep one PR focused on one task; if changes are extensive, consider splitting them into multiple independent PRs.
