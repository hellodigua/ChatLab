Welcome to ChatLab, a free, open-source, and local-first application dedicated to chat record analysis.

We want you to have full control over your chat data, provided it is done within a legal and compliant framework. Please read the following terms carefully:

## 1. Core Functionality & Independence

- **Analysis Only, No Exporting**: This tool is designed solely for analyzing chat records that have already been exported. We do not provide any decryption, packet capture, or extraction tools. Obtaining data from third-party chat applications is your personal action.
- **Independent Third-Party Tool**: This is an independent open-source project and has no affiliation with any third-party companies or organizations.

## 2. Data Privacy & Security

- **Purely Local Analysis**: By default, the storage and analysis of chat records are performed entirely on your local device with **zero uploading**.
- **AI Feature Exception**: If you voluntarily enable AI features, relevant chat data will be sent to your configured third-party model provider (e.g., DeepSeek, Tongyi Qianwen, etc.). **Do not send information involving state secrets or highly sensitive personal privacy**, at your own risk.
- **Functional Networking**: The application connects to the network to fetch update prompts, help documentation, and system prompt configurations. This operation is solely for obtaining the latest information and does not upload any data.
- **Anonymous Usage Statistics**: To optimize the product, the software collects **non-sensitive** data (such as version numbers and operating system types). This data contains no personal information and is used only to assist in future development decisions. You can disable this in the settings at any time.

## 3. Data Authorization & Usage Restrictions

- **Lawful Authorization Principle**: You may only process chat records that you **personally participated in**. If the analyzed content involves the privacy of others (especially **private chat partners or group members**), please ensure you have obtained informed consent from the relevant parties.
- **Forbidden Uses**:
- **Strictly forbidden** to use for stealing, monitoring, or analyzing unauthorized privacy of others.
- **Strictly forbidden** to analyze chat records obtained through illegal means (such as illegal intrusion, account theft, or data hijacking).
- **Strictly forbidden** to use analysis results for harassment, fraud, doxing (human flesh searching), or any actions that infringe upon the rights of others.
- **Strictly forbidden** to use analysis content generated by this software (including AI-generated content) to fabricate or spread false or misleading information.

## 4. Risk Warning

- **Official Channels**: Please download this software only through [chatlab.fun](https://chatlab.fun) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hellodigua/ChatLab/releases).
- **Supply Chain Risk**: The source code of this project is completely open-source and can be repackaged by anyone. Non-official versions shared by others may contain malicious code that could lead to the leakage of your API tokens, chat records, or local data. Please stay vigilant.
- **Accuracy of Results**: Analysis results generated by the software and AI may contain errors or "hallucinations". They are for reference only and should not be used as legal evidence or as a basis for formal decision-making.

## 5. Disclaimer

- **Software Purpose**: This software is intended for technical research, learning, and communication purposes only.
- **Platform Compliance**: Users assume full responsibility for the compliance of their actions in obtaining chat records. The author assumes no liability if an account is restricted due to analysis behavior violating the original data source platform's terms of service.
- **Sole Responsibility**: All consequences arising from the use of this software (including but not limited to data loss, privacy disputes, and legal liabilities) shall be borne solely by the user.
- **Acceptance of Statement**: By downloading, installing, or using this software, you indicate that you have read, understood, and agreed to all terms of this statement. If you do not agree, please stop using the software immediately and delete all related programs.
